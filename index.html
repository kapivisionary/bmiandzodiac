    <div style="background-color:grey;"> <p>
BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It is a numerical value calculated based on a person's weight and height. 
The BMI is used as a screening tool to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height.
It provides a rough estimate of body fat and helps determine if a person is <a href="https://youtu.be/sjprbUirHgQ " title="video">underweight</a>, normal weight,  overweight, or <a href="https://youtu.be/UKnhbqIM0wo" title="video">obese</a>.

The formula to calculate BMI is as follows:

BMI = weight (in kilograms) / (height (in meters))^2

Alternatively, you can use the following formula if weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches:

BMI = (weight (in pounds) / (height (in inches))^2) x 703

Once you calculate your BMI, it falls into one of the following categories:

<b>Underweight:</b> BMI less than 18.5
<b>Normal weight:</b> BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
<b>Overweight:</b> BMI between 25 and 29.9
<b>Obese:</b> BMI of 30 or higher
It's important to note that while BMI is a useful screening tool for most people, it does have limitations. 
For example, it doesn't take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and distribution of fat, 
which can vary among individuals. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional 
for a comprehensive assessment of your health.

    <p style="color:black">
      Once upon a time, in a celestial realm, there was a gathering of twelve wise and ancient beings known as the Zodiac
      Council. Each member of the council possessed unique qualities and embodied the essence of a specific zodiac sign.
      The council believed that the alignment of the stars and planets at the time of a person's birth influenced their 
      destiny and shaped their character. They decided to create a system that would reflect these celestial influences
      and provide guidance to those on Earth.
      The council convened for twelve consecutive nights, each night dedicated to the creation of a distinct zodiac sign. 
      They carefully studied the patterns of the cosmos and imbued each sign with its own symbolic representation and meaning.
      As the first rays of dawn broke on the twelfth day, the council completed their work. <b>Aries</b>, the first sign, was bestowed 
      with the spirit of courage, determination, and leadership.<b>Taurus</b>, the second sign, embodied practicality, stability, and 
      a strong work ethic.
      <b>Gemini</b>, the sign of adaptability and curiosity, was represented by the image of twins. <b>Cancer</b>, the compassionate and 
      intuitive  sign, took the form of a nurturing crab. <b>Leo</b>, the charismatic and generous sign, proudly bore the symbol of
      the regal lion.<b>Virgo</b>, with its attention to detail and analytical thinking, was symbolized by the image of a maiden. <b>Libra</b>, 
      the sign of harmony and justice, held the scales as a reminder of the importance of balance. <b>Scorpio</b>, the intense and 
      passionate sign, took the form of a mighty scorpion.
      <b>Sagittarius</b>, the adventurous and optimistic sign, became the archer, forever aiming for new horizons. <b>Capricorn</b>, the  
      sign of ambition and practicality, was represented by the steadfast mountain goat. <b>Aquarius</b>, the independent and innovative 
      sign,carried the vessel of water as a symbol of enlightenment. Finally, <b>Pisces</b>, the empathetic and imaginative sign, was 
      portrayed as two fish swimming in opposite directions, representing duality and the power of intuition.
      With the completion of the zodiac signs, the council dispersed, their wisdom and influence forever embedded in the cosmos.
      From that day forward, people on Earth would look to the zodiac signs as a source of inspiration, guidance, and 
      self-discovery. And so, the meaning of each zodiac sign was woven into the fabric of human existence, as people embraced 
      the qualities bestowed  upon them by the celestial council, seeking to understand themselves and navigate their journey 
      through life.
